## How to use it?
As you can see, there is three files on the repository. There is a readme.md file, not important. The exe file is on the Release section.</p>
to run it on windows. There is also a .jar, to run it on every OS with java (8+)</p>
installed. And there is a .java, to see the raw code. This is not an executable.</p>

### Run the .exe (windows)
To run the .exe file (only for windows), you simply have to double-click on it.</p>

automatically install it. If there is a pop-up, just click "Ok".

### Run the .jar (every OS, java 8+ requierd)

and type:</p>

```
$ java -jar Anti-AFK.jar
